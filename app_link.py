"""Gate a Streamlit tool behind a link minted by the practice-management app.

Drop this file next to the app's entrypoint, set SLUG, and call
`require_app_link()` as the first statement after `st.set_page_config(...)`.

Why this exists
---------------
These tools are public URLs on Streamlit Cloud: the URL *is* the access
control, so anyone who has ever clicked one keeps it after they leave the
firm. Instead of bolting an email and password onto each tool, the app mints a
120-second HMAC-signed link at the moment of the click, and this verifies it.
Nobody types anything; the click count does not change.

Design + threat model:
practice-management/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-tool-link-tokens-design.md

Secrets required (Streamlit Cloud -> app -> Settings -> Secrets):

    TOOL_LINK_SECRET = "the same value as the app's Vercel env"
    APP_ORIGIN = "https://practice-management-omega.vercel.app"

NEVER commit the real TOOL_LINK_SECRET. If this repo is public, a committed
secret lets anyone mint their own links and the whole gate is decorative.
